# Crypt
A library of functions which both encode and decode various ciphers from
"The Code Book" by Simon Singh.
## Restrictions
To make this project possible and for my own sanity, there are some
restrictions on the scope of this project:
1. Each symbol in any cipher is assumed to take at most one char of space. This
may change in future as I would very much __like__ to generalize this project
to the max, however, I would also like to get at least some functionality done.
